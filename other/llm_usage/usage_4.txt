User
hi again, I’m trying to merge polling data with some census data

ChatGPT
Hey! Sounds interesting. You trying to do a left join, or some other kind of merge?

User
left join yeah. i have polls by state and census population estimates by state

ChatGPT
Great, you can use left_join() from dplyr for that. Here’s how:

r
Copy code
merged_data <- left_join(polls, census_data, by = "state")
User
yeah I got that, but it’s giving me warnings?

ChatGPT
Sometimes those warnings come from unmatched keys or different data types. Make sure both datasets have state as the exact same type (character vs factor). You can convert like this:

r
Copy code
polls$state <- as.character(polls$state)
census_data$state <- as.character(census_data$state)
User
ah ok. let me try that… ok warnings gone. but now the population is NA for some states?

ChatGPT
That usually means there’s a mismatch in the state names—maybe one dataset has "DC" instead of "District of Columbia," for example. You could use a lookup table to standardize them before joining.

User
is there a package for that?

ChatGPT
fuzzyjoin might help if the differences are minor. Alternatively, stringdist_left_join() can join based on approximate matches.

User
oh cool, didn’t know that existed. i think I’ll try fuzzyjoin

ChatGPT
Good call! It’s handy for those little discrepancies that mess up exact matches.

User
yeah ok that helped. i got my data merged now. what should I do next?

ChatGPT
Now that it’s merged, consider creating a new variable like poll_weighted using population estimates—so bigger states have a bigger impact on your analysis.

r
Copy code
merged_data <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(poll_weighted = poll_percentage * population_estimate / sum(population_estimate))
User
makes sense. what about visualizing this?

ChatGPT
Try creating a weighted map. ggplot2 can do that, especially if you use geom_map() to visualize the impact by state. You’d need a shapefile or a maps package for that.

User
yeah i got the maps package. any quick example?

ChatGPT
Sure thing:

r
Copy code
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)

states <- map_data("state")
ggplot(data = merged_data) +
  geom_map(aes(map_id = state, fill = poll_weighted), map = states) +
  expand_limits(x = states$long, y = states$lat)
User
sweet. looks pretty good so far. think I’m good

ChatGPT
Awesome, happy to help! Let me know if you need anything else down the road.
